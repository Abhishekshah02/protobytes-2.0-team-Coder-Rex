Project Details 
Project Title: Universal IMU-to-Health Pipeline: Self-Supervised Motion Embeddings for Cross-Device Wearable 
Standardization 

Category: Open Innovation 

Problem Statement: 
Wearable health devices use different data formats, sampling rates, and sensor calibrations, making it impossible to build universal health monitoring applications or compare patient data across devices. This fragmentation forces healthcare providers to use multiple systems, prevents patients from switching devices without losing health continuity, and limits researchers from combining datasets. We propose a self-supervised learning framework that converts IMU data from any wearable into standardized motion embeddings, enabling cross-device interoperability for critical applications like fall detection and patient monitoring.


Solution Overview: 

We propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that: 
✅Learns device-agnostic motion representations without requiring labeled data 
✅Converts raw IMU signals into standardized embeddings that capture the "essence" of motion 
✅Enables cross-device compatibility by training on diverse wearable datasets 
✅Provides a universal API for extracting health insights from any IMU-enabled device 

Impact: 
● Healthcare apps can work with any wearable, not just specific brands 
● Researchers can combine datasets from different studies 
● Patients can switch devices without losing health tracking continuity 
● Developers can build once, deploy everywhere
